# Automated Functional Tests

Modern software is complex. As we increase the amount of code in our product, we lose the ability of holding a complete model of our architecture in our head. Thus, every change we integrate has the potential to affect other code paths unintentionally. To minimize the risk of delivering error-prone software, we run automated functional tests.

Across our industry, we certainly have standardized terminology for categories of functional tests, but we do not have standardized definitions for these. The most popular terms include *unit tests*, *integration tests*, and *end-to-end tests*. However, if we ask three different engineers about the definition of a "unit", we can expect n^3 number of interpretations.

The book *Software Engineering at Google* by Titus Winters, Tom Manshrek, and Hyrum Wright matches these terms to a strictly defined scope and categorizes *narrow-scoped tests*, *medium-scoped tests*, and *large-scoped tests*. Disregarding the specificity of the term *narrow*-scoped, I renamed those to *small-scoped* in this book for the sake of simplicity and common use.

The scope of these tests refers to the difficulty of writing the tests, the complexity of assembling the test dependencies, and finally the execution time of the tests. The larger the scope, the more resources we invest in writing and running the category of test. We execute as broad a coverage of our tests as frequently and early in the development cycle as possible without stalling developer velocity.

When testing on dedicated machinery on-prem, every minute our build and test computer sits idle increases the potential of propagating a faulty state down the line. However, every processing minute on third-party cloud runners increases our costs. Depending on our needs, we either buy more minutes, offload some tests to on-prem runners, or reduce the scope of tests and run larger tests less frequently.

To highlight the appropriate distribution of scoped test sizes within our software, Mike Cohn provides a metaphorical representation in his book *Succeeding with agile*. The three-layered *testing pyramid* counsels us on the relative amount of automated tests for each scope. As a rule of thumb, when ascending the pyramid, every layer of the reduces the number of tests by an order of magnitude. If we start at a thousand small-scoped tests, we aim for a hundred medium-scoped tests, and no more than ten large-scoped tests.

[![Testing Pyramid](../../../assets/images/book/collaborating-within-a-codebase/testing/testing-pyramid.webp)](../../../assets/images/book/collaborating-within-a-codebase/testing/testing-pyramid.png)

Small-scoped unit tests build the base of the pyramid. Commonly referred to as *unit tests*, they ensure correct behavior within a system. The number small-scoped tests spans about 75%-90% of the automated tests in our software and we execute these frequently. It is not uncommon for developers to run the small-scoped suite of tests every couple of minutes while working on the source code. Generally, executing all of our small-scoped tests takes seconds.

The mid-layer consists of medium-scoped tests, or integration tests. When executing these tests we verify the behavior between embedded or connected systems. The process requires us to spawn these dependent systems in order to run the tests. In the section *Medium-Scoped Tests* we explore how to reduce the complexity of the procedure. We expect our medium-scoped test suite to complete in minutes.

The pinnacle of the pyramid consists of automated large-scoped tests. These follow an interaction flow across the entire product, from user input to system processing back to user response. Thus, these tests are commonly known as *end-to-end tests*. Large-scoped tests tend to be difficult to write, face complex challenges to set-up and execute, and are generally long-running operations. Automated large-scoped tests consume hours of our testing budget.

The testing pyramid promises us the most bang for our buck. If we are able to run the majority of our tests in seconds, we catch errors as quickly as possible. Any error reported by small-scoped tests took us seconds to uncover. When running against medium or larged-scoped tests, fixing an error occupies us for hours if not days.

A common anti-pattern to this approach is the *testing snow cone*, or *inverted testing pyramid*. These projects contain little to no small-scoped tests with all the testing done in medium-to-large-scoped tests, combined with labor and time-intensive manual tests. Flipping the distribution of scopes results in long test runs and slow feedback cycles.

The test snow cone typically emerges from legacy software that was not written with testability in mind. Closed-off systems make it difficult to test individual steps and a lack of dependency-injection prevents us from writing light-weight in-memory tests. Besides that, a lack of ownership in infrastructure or testing workflows may invert our testing pyramid. If we find it difficult to write, update, and execute tests, we lack the motivation to do so and shift the responsibility to QA.

 Over the rest of this chapter we'll explore our testing scopes in detail.

## Small-Scoped Tests

The advantage of small-scoped tests lies in the little amount of resources they require. The limitations we enforce and the isolated nature of small focused tests make the the code straightforward to write and easy to maintain. Small-scoped tests execute speedily without arranging external dependencies. Our software commonly contains thousands of small-scoped tests, all collectively executed in seconds.

We limit small-scoped tests to the fastest possible testable entity in our code, in-memory operations. Small-scoped tests do not run disk operations or network operations. They do not not sleep, make other blocking calls, or consume other OS processes. These factors are covered by medium-scoped tests. Writing source code and its tests code with these constraints in mind, enables us to verify a broad set of behavior with minimal effort.

The limitations on their complexity make small-scoped tests rapid. Hence, we run them as often as possible. Their small footprint facilitates executing them during every step of the development cycle: while coding on our local machines, on pre-merge checks, post-merge validations, and as pre-release requirements. A complete suite of passing small-scoped tests increases the confidence of introducing changes without irritating our code base.

Every serious programming language ships with tooling for writing and executing small-scoped tests. Numerous blogs, tutorials, and guides cover setting up these tests for any language in any integrated development environment. Beyond the limitations highlighted above, we suggest following our programming languages most supported practices.

## Medium-Scoped Tests

Incrementing our nomenclature by a size, medium-scoped tests verify the expected behavior between embedded and connected systems and validate the interactions between our software and its execution environment. Typical medium-scoped tests check features on different operating systems, read and write files from disk, connect to network endpoints, and confirm the interaction between subsystems of our product, e.g. a service with a database, a service with a connected service, or inter-process communication.

In order to test against these environments, we need to set them up. While we could build physical test farms consisting of dedicated hardware for different environments, this approach becomes unwieldy for modern software requirements. The sheer amalgamation of execution environments grew exponentially over the years. We cannot store and maintain every Android device on the market, nor can we provide Windows machinery with all combinations of graphic card models and their various drivers.

Besides adaptability, running on dedicated but a limited amount of hardware introduces a bottleneck to our testing availability. Once our testing frequency surpasses our testing load we delay discovering any breaking changes in our software. Additionally, if we cannot isolate test runs on shared hardware we influence other test runs. Tests that leave the environment in a non-neutral state tarnish all following executions, and parallel tests competing over limited resources lead to flaky test results.

To counter these problems, we move from wholly physical environments to software-defined infrastructure. Virtual machines and containers allow us to isolate various test environments on shared machinery. To ensure hermeticity across sessions and devices, we use declarative and imperative tools to construct consistent testing infrastructure. Thus, any machine with the required virtualization technology installed may run our test cases.

To run medium-scoped tests and large-scoped tests in virtualized environments, we provide the infrastructure declarations with the source code itself. We place our setup scripts and definition files for test environments in the same repository and version it with our code changes. This allows our engineers to spawn the same test environment on their development machine that runs on our build servers. Hard coupling between source code and infrastructure code enables us to recreate the infrastructure our software expects at any given version.

### Test Doubles

We prefer to test against real implementations of connected systems. While modern container offerings make this goal achievable more often than not, unfortunately, sometimes, real implementations are too complex or costly to set up for frequent isolated runs. In these situations test doubles stand in as lightweight alternatives. Depending on their implementation, we categorize test doubles as *stubs*, *mocks*, or *fakes*.

*Stubs* replace external dependencies with hard-coded responses. These canned implementations allow us to test code paths where response values are expected, but its content proves insignificant to our test case. *Stubs* require low effort and often consist of a single return value for stubbed methods. Initially typed out manually, sophisticated code bases may eventually autogenerate these based on source code. Example:

```golang
// Stub method for host/product/db/user.go#43
//
//   GetUsername(id int) string
//
func GetUsername(id int) string {
    return "stubbed_username"
}
```

If we require interactivity in our tests, we write *mock* implementations. Stateful objects with the minimum fidelity needed for our tests.

```golang
// Mock implementation for host/product/db

type MockDB struct {
    users map[int]string
}

func (db *MockDB) CreateUsername(username string) (int, error) {
    _, exists := db.users[id]
    if exists {
        return -1, fmt.Errorf("user with id %d already exists", id)
    }

    db.id++
    db.users[db.id] = username
    return nil, db.id
}

func (db *MockDB) GetUsername(id int) string {
    username, _ := db.users[id]
    return username
}

func (db *MockDB) UpdateUsername(id int, username string) error {
    _, exists := db.users[id]
    if !exists {
        return fmt.Errorf("user with id %d does not exist", id)
    }

    db.users[id] = username
    return nil
}

func (db *MockDB) DeleteUsername(id int) {
    delete(db.users, id)
}
```

For our tests we pass the mock implementation.

```golang
func Test_AuthenticateUserFromPayload(t *testing.T) {
    service := CreateNewService()
    mockDB := CreateNewMockDB()
    service.SetDB(mockDB)

    // run whatever tests we want
    // ...
}
```

These terms refer to differing strategies in terms of fidelity and execution cost. By definition, perfect fidelity with doubles is not feasible, as these need to be vastly simpler than the real implementation to be suitable for use in our tests.

Fakes require effort and domain knowledge to behave similarly to the real implementation. If the real implementation changes, so must the fake. Depending on the nature of the doubles used, testing against these organically leads to testing against processes instead of behaviors, which leads to brittle tests (as covered in [Good Practices](./good-practices.md)).

&nbsp; | Stub | Mock | Fake
-|-|-|-
**Purpose** | Provide predefined responses | Verify interactions | Simulate functionality
**Behavior** | Passive | Active, validates behavior | Functional alternative
**Complexity** | Simple | Requires setup for validation | Often more complex

The simplicity of test doubles compared to their complex counterparts reduces the flakiness of MSTs. When tests fail against test doubles, we gain certainty that the issues originate in our source, rather than the dependency.

A fake database does not have the fidelity of a real database but maintains fidelity to the API contracts. A fake does not keep fidelity to latency and resource consumption and is therefore unreliable to provide information about race conditions, timeouts, or benchmarking.

With modern software development tooling, testing against real implementations becomes the more commonplace practice. We build and test against all operating systems on our build machines, and it has become trivial to spin up lightweight ephemeral containers of our preferred database for MSTs.

MSTs' complexity and computational requirements position them to be executed after code changes are merged to main. Should we find that our MSTs utilize fewer resources than expected and code integrations to our main branch frequently fail, we consider moving them to pre-merge.

## Large-Scoped Tests

Large-scoped tests (LST) test the flow of commands from user input across different APIs, serialization strategies, and verify that the returned behavior is as expected.

Within the cosmology of automated testing, LSTs represent the most expensive, complex, and lengthy test suite to set up and execute. Commonly referred to as *end-to-end tests* or *system tests*, they cover the pinnacle of the testing pyramid. From bottom to top, every layer of the pyramid reduces the number of tests by an order of magnitude. A project containing 1000 SSTs includes 100 MSTs and comprises no more than 10 LSTs.

LSTs are so subjective to the organizations and products they are run in; no solution applies across companies. The technology stack and approach of game companies have little in common with the approach of cloud providers, which, in turn, differs tremendously from mobile applications or embedded systems. The complex nature of LST makes disregarding them altogether a **valid option**.

Due to the complexity and effort of creating environments for LSTs, an instinctive initial approach is to run a second deployment, identical to the live production, dedicated to staging and verifying our changes. This approach may well be a good solution for us, but it is an expensive endeavor and does not scale well.

An increasing number of teams staging changes to the same environment inflates the brittleness of said environment. Forcing a massive end-to-end test environment introduces problematic correlations and false positives or negatives. If we do offer LST staging areas, we must ensure every team can spin up a fenced-off instance to singularly test changes specified by that team.

The sheer herculean effort of running LSTs excludes them from being run as part of the merging process. At a minimum, though, we run LSTs as part of the pre-release process. We may execute LST on our main branch periodically during the week, preferably at nighttime to minimize interference with resources during active development. While LSTs can be run over the weekend, coming to the office on a Monday morning to failed test alerts of non-production technology is a stressful way to start the week.

### Contract Testing

Similar to test doubles introduced in MSTs, contract testing presents an alternative to testing against implementations in an LST environment. Whereas test doubles require technology domain experience, contract testing is built upon cross-team communication effort. Establishing consumer-driven contracts formalizes the clear lines of communication between vertical teams enforced by the team interactions discussed in [Team Interactions](../../collaborating-within-a-company/team-interactions.md).

Contract tests validate established agreements between teams as instituted in the consumer-driven contracts. Contracts are drawn up between team members of the consumer service and the provider service, both of whom participate in writing the contract tests. All consumer contract tests are run against our pending implementation in the provider services to certify our changes do not break dependent behavior.

Contract testing extends static strategies such as API testing and schema testing and requires more collaboration between contract parties. API testing and schema testing work exceptionally well when our organization embraces documentation-driven development, a practice where documentation is written first, and boilerplate code is generated based on the schema of the documentation. This kind of testing requires a lack of documentation drift, a fact realistically achievable if the documentation drives source code, not the other way round. [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a popular standard with a rich economy of open source tooling.

    - Hyrum Wright
<!-- vale Vale.Avoid = YES -->

Hyrum's law states that every public-facing behavior of our implementation will be relied upon. While this includes error types and return codes, it also covers incidental actions, such as data layouts (e.g., if a seemingly random return value always follows the same pattern) and execution time (e.g., performance upgrades might trigger hitherto undetected race conditions).

We cannot foresee or control how third-party systems depend on our implementation, and we question the feasibility of testing all public-facing characteristics of our implementation. We are aware that changes might be incompatible with current dependencies, and it is up to us to weigh the responsibility we delegate to our consumers.
