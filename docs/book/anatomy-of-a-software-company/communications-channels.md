# Communication Channels

Communication is all exchange of information necessary to complete our task. The typical tools available for us to cultivate levels of communication are (but not limited to):

- In-person Meetings
- Virtual meetings
- Emails
- Direct messages
- Forums, Channels
- Office layout
- Work pairing
- "Water cooler" conversations
- Asynchronous code review
- Documentation
- Issues and bug reports
- Status updates
- After work drinks

This broad collection of communication tools allows us to enable channels of various types of information exchange. From low-noise high-concentration work to collaborative work and cross-disciplinary brainstorming.

## Communication medium aspects

Communication channels present individual strengths and weaknesses, which are typically complementary. We distinguish between the following aspects of the communication media to highlight the appropriate tool selection for our communication purposes.

- **Immediacy**  
  How quickly is the information received and read? How quickly can we expect a reply?
- **Audience reach**  
  What amount of people do we reach with this medium?
- **Investment**  
  How much time are we required to spend for preparation, drafting, attending?
- **Longevity**  
  How ephemeral is the medium? Is the information archived? How accurately does the information age?
- **Searchability**  
  Are we able to search for semantic content and references within the information? Longevity by itself is necessary for audits, compliance, and potential legal issues, but longevity without searchability is pointless for daily business.
- **Context**  
  Is the medium referencing work? Can we attach information? Do we know who is sharing information and in what their position might be to the shared information?

Meetings, both virtual and in-person, are immediate. Information is shared, received, processed and responded to within seconds. However, meetings do require a high amount of investment due to preparation time and full task switching of all attendees. Meeting minutes, transcripts and recordings increase longevity and searchability.

Emails, instant messages and channel posts have decent immediacy and the asynchronous advantage that people are not forced to abandon the tasks they are working on. Written messages suffer from the lack of body language and tone and require slightly more effort to phrase accordingly. Additional context can be established through URL and attachments. Naturally, forums and email servers are archived and available for decades.

Code reviews, status updates, bug reports, and documentation offer the highest amount of organic context, as the communication body is attached to referred work. When dealing with evolving products, such as code, it's considered good practice to hard reference the version of the product.

Let's keep in mind, that we are never restricted to a single form of communication. Generally it is better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate when it comes to media and channels. This avoids misunderstandings, accidental loss of information, or the impression that information is being withheld <!-- vale write-good.Weasel = NO -->deliberately<!-- vale write-good.Weasel = YES -->.

## Social aspect of communication

Human communication problems can be mistaken for technical problems. Communication problems with the IT department may result in building a new ticketing system, instead of establishing low-effort communication channels. Technology alone does not strengthen personal connections.

Nurturing direct communication and social relationships is a catalyst for increased productivity. Building baseline trust over time reduces communication barriers and shortens the time needed to get work done. The most driving facilitator of strengthening bonds are in-person meetings. For geographically distributed teams try to meet at least once a year, ideally 4 times per year.

New tools, team members, or management require additional communication until sufficient time and energy has been invested. When our teams are stretched thin, they can take out their frustration when practices aren't working as <!-- vale write-good.Weasel = NO -->smoothly<!-- vale write-good.Weasel = YES --> as before. Across cultures, languages, and personalities people need to make adjustments to their expectations of processes and behaviors to avoid friction.

Negative communication behavior can express itself as non-constructive criticism, contempt of defensiveness towards other teams or team members or a complete emotional distancing towards the team. Throughout a product lifecycle it is natural to go through emotional up and downs towards a product or task, the initial hype of the kick-off event is not sustainable.

We need to stay on the lookout that emotional disregard does not extend itself towards team members. Communicative indicators are blanket accusations of "we always" or "they never". These symptoms lead to an us vs them mentality across our teams which lower delivery frequency and quality across our organization.

Our culture and feelings toward each other mirror the form of communication we have, which always find a way into the product we ship and therefore into our market competitiveness.

!!! note
    Too much conflict avoidance leads to a homogeneity of thought that reduces creativity and problem-solving skills. Our employees are not children. We can expect our peers to be able to communicate like adults. Until they can't and a designated person steps in as a mediator.

    As with everything in this book, communication is an ongoing process that we continuously learn to improve.

## Transparency

Our communication channels are public per default and available to every member of our organization. This does not mean we encourage every member to join every communication channel, but we certainly do not want to arbitrarily limit the flow of information. We encouraging people to attend each others meetings for more visibility into what different parts of the organization are working on. Our policy, enforced socially, not technologically, is everyone gets to listen, not everyone gets to speak.

Successful software products need input from fiscal and market realities. Executives providing clear and non-conflicting vision of business direction helps creating realistic timescales and clear reasoning behind priorities.

Communication helps build resilience among individuals and teams - letting people know that they are not alone, allowing them to share coping strategies, and transferring knowledge between both people and groups, having a significant impact on the organization as a whole.

All of our internal media is public to every team member. This includes source code, development environments, documentation, and assigned tasks and backlog. We actively encourage our employees to confer about work in progress and completed work. If our employees are able to access all knowledge that was tackled throughout the history of our organization we drastically reduce duplicated work and initial research phases.

Non-harmful exceptions to this transparency rule include necessary compliance enforcement, security driven decisions and C-level market driving decisions such as potential acquisitions.
