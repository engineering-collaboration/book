# Documenting decisions

Making decisions is a speculative process. Even ones deduced from considerable experience and data points are still predicting the future. Recording our decision making process and the outcomes improves the precision of our fortune telling over time as we can identify successful and unsuccessful patterns.

## Decision records

[Red Hat published an article](https://www.redhat.com/architect/architecture-decision-records) about their process of documenting software architecture decisions using *architecture decision records* (ADR). Expanding beyond the demands of software architecture, a general base framework for recording decisions includes the following properties.

- Date and Title
- Context
    - Problem statement
    - Solution options
    - People involved
- Decision
    - Solution
    - Advantages
    - Drawbacks

The more context we are able to give, the more transparent our decision is communicated. We explain the relevant success indicators and evaluate potential options. We include the names and titles of the people involved in the decision as a future contact for context we cannot translate into written form.

Every decision has advantages and disadvantages which are unambiguously weighed against each other. If the decision evaluation process is written down and available, people are more likely to accept a conscious decision and its drawbacks.

The world is not static. With changing environmental parameters or organizational needs we might reevaluate passed decisions moving forward.
