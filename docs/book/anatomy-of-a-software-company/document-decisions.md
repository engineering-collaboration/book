# Documenting decisions

Decision making is always speculative. Even with lots of data to rely on, we are predicting the future.

Make a decision and document it. Easier for people to accept a conscious decision if the decision making process is available.
Document the outcome of a decision, to track successful and unsuccessful patterns.

Document, review, and iterate to ensure every participant understands the same thing. Take notes during meetings and share them with everybody to avoid misunderstandings.

Keep all of the above decisions and progress visible and public to all stakeholders. Update continously. Maybe tooling that accumulates PR, issue comments, documentation, kanban boards, design docs etc.

The more context we are able to give, the more transparent our decision is communicated. When evaluating the use of different libraries add the name and version of the libraries, benchmark numbers, ease of implementation, licensing, projected maintenance work etc.

We clearly define the evaluation process that led to our final decision with all aspects. Every decision has advantages and drawbacks which need to be documented and unambiguously weighed against each other.

Parameters change over time and decisions will be reevaluated.
