# Collaborating within a Company

Decisions made in the upper echelons of our organization trade immediacy for greater overall outcome and consequence. Yet immediate decisions and action strengthens our market competitiveness. We analyze which decisions to delegate. Product and implementation strategies need to be delegated. We focus on organizational problems and high-level architecture.

In order to delegate immediacy, we build an enviornment that empowers our teams to immediacy. Product problems should be solved before reaching top-level personell. We lay the foundation of our software with our organization's topology.

## Inverse Conway Maneuvre

The shape of our product becomes apparent by observing our teams' structures - before a single line of code is written. Visualizing our company's communication channels determines our software project's success rate and development time.

!!! quote
    *"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."*  
    - Melvin E. Conway

    *"If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler."*  
    - Eric S. Raymond

    *"The architecture of the system gets cemented in the forms of the teams that develop it."*  
    - Ruth Malan

    *"Someone who claims to be an [Software] architect needs both technical and social skills. They also need a remit that is broader than pure technology - they need to have a say in business strategies, organizational structures, and personnel issues."*  
    - Allan Kelly

The above quotes refer to Conway's Law. It observes the universal behavior that our software architecture ultimately copies our organization's team layout. Utilizing Conway's Law as a tool, the *Inverse Conway Maneuver* states that we design our organization around our desired software architecture and continuous delivery flow, not the other way around.

Moving people and teams in a way to design communication channels more efficiently will ultimately and organically lead to less friction in software delivery.

## Growth mindset

Much like we cannot force departments to follow a software architecture that does not match their team structure, we cannot change our team's behavior by changing their beliefs; we change their beliefs by changing people's behavior.

Theoretical "best" practices and academic anecdotes do not change the practices present in our organization. We build sociotechnical frameworks to establish a growth mindset. We build channels to encourage organic collaboration while limiting noise.

Part I discusses strategies for cultivating a growth mindset and sustainably increasing the complexity of our product.

This part covers tools and strategies at an organizational level to encourage dynamic and autonomous teams. Flexible teams will enable our organization to adapt to market changes more rapidly.

The content within this book is what we have found most useful across a broad range of organizations. We consider these as rough guidelines, and we may certainly want to adapt, change, or disregard certain aspects for our organization. We do not delude ourselves as expecting a one-size-fits-all solution to this expansive topic.
