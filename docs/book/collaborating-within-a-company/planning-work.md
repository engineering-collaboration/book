# Planning work

Decision timelines and implications are driven from the top of the organizational hierarchy and turn more granular the further down the hierarchy we travel. 

The board and our C-level executives weather the storms of macro-economic realities and long-term visions. C-level executives in combination with the organization's board tackle problems of the companies (and products) position within the market in the next 1-5 years, when and how to fund the development, how to scale and where to open new locations.

Depending on our department VP's and product break these down into yearly goals, which get organised as quaterlies.

Thus we created a wishlist. A document detailing the illusion of having any control in the world.

A lot of smart people have written their opinions on the above, which is beyond the scope of this chapter.

We are considering the execution. Once a quaterly roadmap exists and our backlogs have been filled. We are talking about sprints.

## Sprints

Popular manifestors disguised as Scrum and Agile practices lead with the prime existance of sprints to deliver shippable packages every sprint for feedback cycles. This believe has survived the last decades but we want to declare it dead. The goal of a sprint is not to deliver software packages ready to be shipped. Our software is shippable multiple times a day. We discuss this further in Part II. For the majority of software, a feedback cycle measured in weeks is unacceptable. Notable exceptions are Due to security in defense, compliance in aviation, privacy in healthcare, and maximum fiscal extraction of governmental projects.

Sprints protect our team's time. We contain distraction and agree on priorities. A sprint cycle has no relationship to the deliverable of our software. It is a temporal cycle to protect our engineers, communicate within teams, and evangelize changes.

## Velocity and story points

Velocity uses arbitrary units (commonly "story points") as a tool to measure workload achievable over a given amount of time.

After a certain amount of sprints we can realistically deduce how many story points our team can achieve per sprint and share realsitic plans and expectations.

Story points only work team internally. Story points cannot be directly used as a measurement for productivity across teams. The mix of tools, communication channels, personalities, infrastructure deployments, office layouts, etc are likely to be unique to our team. Comparing story points across teams is as useful information as comparing the shoe sizes across teams.

## Backlog

## Who decides what to work on

With the broad vision documented, "VP"'s, "Head of"'s, and "Director"'s plan a road map for the next 6 - 24 months to set our organization up for success.

Together with team leads the planned features are mapped to achievable milestones with the available resources for the next two quarters.

Team leads plan sprints and 

C-level executives and the organization's board documented the organizations vision and market position. VP's design the necessary product and internal milestones to steer the organization in the requested direction. In cooperation with team leads the milestones are mapped to available resources.

With a dedicated road map in hand it is 

1 year to 5 years

Organization vision CEO/Board

funding, location, remote work, scaling

Technology vision CTO/Director of Engineering

Product vision and compliance CPO Head of product

Planning work

6 months - 2 years

Product - Feature
Values, roadmap, strategie for market

1 month - 6 months

Management - Split and milestones
Continous integration strategies of milestones and sprints

2 days to 4 weeks

Engineer - Details, libraries, implementation
Implementation details, algorithms, open source libraries vs building

## Keeping up to date - during sprints

Tasks / Subtasks

## Presenting work - end of sprints

presenting work
evangelizing work just as important as working on features
sharing progress
how long are sprints
presentations vs screenrecordings

startups need short sprints (1 week) need to pivot, address feedback
enterprises benefit from 3 week sprints of uninterrupted changes
don't start sprints on mondays or fridays
thursday or tuesday are good days.

## Measuring productivity

We want our employees to be focused on delivering quality work for our product. Not on focusing to optimize their productivity for internal metrics.

## careful

technical debt
refactoring
irrelevant bugfixes
