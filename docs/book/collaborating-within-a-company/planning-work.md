# Planning work

<!-- The fallacy of planning long-term -->

The fallacy of planning long-term strategies involves guessing customer needs, evaluating customer feedback, analyzing market positioning, considering funding strategies, placating investor needs, assessing talent availability, estimating our hiring effectiveness, scaling marketing and sales demands, and predicting macro-economic realities while praying for low cost of capital.

We separate external forces into those we can control and those we cannot, those we can influence and those we have to react to. Our short term, mid term, and long term tasks need to cover our customers and organization's needs and stay flexible enough to pivot in case we need to react to changing circumstances.

Talented people have conquered the witchcraft and augury of these decision timelines and implications. Beyond single statistical outliers. Requires emotional stability in times of uncertainty. Constantly pivoting and reacting means we do not get anywhere. Knowing when to steady a course and when to charter a new course largely industry insights, experience, and luck. None of which are part of this chapter.

The further down the organization's hierarchy we wander, the more granular and actionable our task planning becomes. An example, if our product roadmap presents cloud storage capabilities in Q3 of this year, our CTO and chief architects map our software requirements to teams and establish communication channels. Senior engineers design architecture within their respective domain of infrastructure, deployment, security, and content delivery and lead engineers share their wishes and needs regarding protocols and API's and deliverables across teams. Within the team we come to a consesus of languages, frameworks, and libraries. To the engineer writing and commenting the lines of code.

<!-- From product roadmap to tickets -->
This chapter covers planning perspectives from mid to long term, after a product roadmap has been established.

Together with team leads the planned features are mapped to achievable milestones with the available resources for the next two quarters. In cooperation with team leads the milestones are mapped to available resources.

Team leads plan sprints and create backlog.

Have senior engineers write tickets.

Who are tickets for. Tickets are not engineering oriented. Any information relating to code, stored away from code is useless. Authorization, platform migration, searchability. We cover this in detail in Part II.

## Sprints

<!-- What is a sprint -->

To continously improve our work procedure we 

A sprint is a continous cycle of integrating work. Planning, implementation, retrospective.
When a sprint is booked, we do not pivot mid sprint. Dedicated time to solve the problems at hand.
We can interrupt sprints for 911 calls and hotfixes, but these need to be urgent and immediate, otherwise we do not get any work done.

<!-- What is a sprint NOT -->

Popular manifestors disguised as Scrum and Agile practices lead with the prime existance of sprints to deliver shippable packages every sprint for feedback cycles. This believe has survived the last decades but we want to declare it dead.

The goal of a sprint is not to deliver software packages ready to be shipped. Our software is shippable multiple times a day. We discuss this further in Part II. For the majority of software, a feedback cycle measured in weeks is unacceptable. Notable exceptions are Due to security in defense, compliance in aviation, privacy in healthcare, and maximum fiscal extraction of governmental projects.

Sprints protect our team's time. We contain distraction and agree on priorities. A sprint cycle has no relationship to the deliverable of our software. It is a temporal cycle to protect our engineers, communicate within teams, and evangelize changes.

## Velocity and story points

We are aware that the use of terms *backlog*, *sprints*, and *burncharts* cause involuntary reactions of ill-well. Please, take a moment to breathe and rest assured we do not convert our readers to the church of Agile. Zealous practices find little foothold within *Engineering Collaboration*.

Another term tainting the back of our tongue with bile is *Story points*.
Velocity uses arbitrary units (commonly "story points") as a tool to measure workload achievable over a given amount of time.

After a certain amount of sprints we can realistically deduce how many story points our team can achieve per sprint and share realsitic plans and expectations.

Story points only work team internally. Story points cannot be directly used as a measurement for productivity across teams. The mix of tools, communication channels, personalities, infrastructure deployments, office layouts, etc are likely to be unique to our team. Comparing story points across teams is as useful information as comparing the shoe sizes across teams.

Plan for unexpected work

Estimating storypoints

## Keeping up to date - during sprints

Tasks / Subtasks
Dailies are a waste of time
Identify blockers
keep it to 60 seconds per person, if longer have a separate meeting
If needed daily keep it written
Help identify potential distractions, e.g. hat to help X, Y reached out for support, I am working on Z with U
Making sure people do not get off task too much or create major sub tasks; we can add these to next sprint

## Presenting work - end of sprints

presenting work
evangelizing work just as important as working on features
sharing progress
how long are sprints
presentations vs screenrecordings

startups need short sprints (1 week) need to pivot, address feedback
enterprises benefit from 3 week sprints of uninterrupted changes
don't start sprints on mondays or fridays
thursday or tuesday are good days.

Engineer - Details, libraries, implementation
Implementation details, algorithms, open source libraries vs building

## Measuring productivity

We want our employees to be focused on delivering quality work for our product. Not on focusing to optimize their productivity for internal metrics.

## careful

technical debt
refactoring
irrelevant bugfixes
