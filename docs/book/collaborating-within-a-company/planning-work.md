# Velocity and story points

Velocity uses arbitrary units (commonly "story points") as a tool to measure workload achievable over a given amount of time.

After a certain amount of sprints we can realistically deduce how many story points our team can achieve per sprint and share realsitic plans and expectations.

Story points only work team internally. Story points cannot be directly used as a measurement for productivity across teams. The mix of tools, communication channels, personalities, infrastructure deployments, office layouts, etc are likely to be unique to our team. Comparing story points across teams is as useful information as comparing the shoe sizes across teams.

Plan for unexpected work


## Who decides what

Decision timelines and implications are driven from the top of the organizational hierarchy and turn more granular the further down the hierarchy we travel. C-level executives in combination with the organization's board tackle problems of the companies (and products) position within the market in the next 1-5 years, when and how to fund the development, how to scale and where to open new locations.

With the broad vision documented, "VP"'s, "Head of"'s, and "Director"'s plan a road map for the next 6 - 24 months to set our organization up for success.

Together with team leads the planned features are mapped to achievable milestones with the available resources for the next two quarters.

C-level executives and the organization's board documented the organizations vision and market position. VP's design the necessary product and internal milestones to steer the organization in the requested direction. In cooperation with team leads the milestones are mapped to available resources.

## Measuring productivity

We want our employees to be focused on delivering quality work for our product. Not on focusing to optimize their productivity for internal metrics.
