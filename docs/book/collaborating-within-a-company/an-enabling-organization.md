# An Enabling Organization

We cannot change people's behavior by changing their minds; we change their minds by changing people's behavior. Preaching "best" practices and academic anecdotes will not change the culture present in our organization. Our culture is controlled by the professional and social frameworks we establish within our organization. The values and beliefs, explicitly and implicitly framed by our organization's hierarchy and interactions, drive our cultural movement.

Hence, facilitating collaboration structures promotes a collaborative culture and thinking. Facilitating communication channels fosters clean and efficient communication between people. Facilitating transparent requirements for career progression within our organization supports the organic professional development of our employees.

## The Inverse Conway Maneuver

!!! quote
    *"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."*  
    - Melvin E. Conway

    *"If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler."*  
    - Eric S. Raymond

    *"The architecture of the system gets cemented in the forms of the teams that develop it."*  
    - Ruth Malan

    *"Someone who claims to be an [Software] architect needs both technical and social skills. They also need a remit that is broader than pure technology - they need to have a say in business strategies, organizational structures, and personnel issues."*  
    - Allan Kelly

The above quotes refer to Conway's Law. In layman's terms, it observes the universal law that our software architecture ultimately copies our organization's team layout. Typically, this is interpreted as a warning in organizations with strict disciplinary silos.

Within this book (and several others written by smarter people), we redefine Conway's Law not as a hurdle but as a tool. The *Inverse Conway Maneuver* states that we design our organization around our desired software architecture and continuous delivery flow, not the other way around. Moving people and teams in a way to design communication channels more efficiently will ultimately and organically lead to less friction in software delivery.

We do not design the architecture of our software and force our departments to follow it; we design the architecture of our software and organize our departments to map the architecture.
