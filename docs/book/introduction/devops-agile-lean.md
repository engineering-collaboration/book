# DevOps, Agile, Lean

Arguably these terms have become quite fashionable. Most notably "agile" has been a trending term for a while with various flavours popping up over the years and multiple consultancies and tooling providers offer "best practice" solutions.

In order to avoid any tribalism, bias, or emotional connotation this book will avoid these terms as best feasible and use the titular term "collaboration" concluding this chapter.

Somewhat cynically, we want to highlight that we do not "win" by implementing Agile or DevOps. Our customer base does not magically double because we introduce daily standup meetings. The sole motivator for change within organizational structures must be to strengthen market competitiveness.

## The three values of collaboration in software

Disregarding various flavours of DevOps, DevSecOps, Agile, Lean, et al, these principles are founded on identical core philosophies. These philosophies can be consolidated into the following three categories and build the basis of this book.

### Iterative and incremental development

We prioritize delivering working software as swiftly as possible, and then continuously improving it through a series of iterative cycles. Using this approach we create organic feedback loops between development and customers. This makes our company more adaptable to business needs, organizational needs, market needs, technological needs, personnel needs, and political needs.

Ideally, each change integrated into our product keeps our product in a deliverable state, shifting the dynamic of our software from a "product for users" towards a "conversation with users". This drastically reduces work of questionable business value, including partially done work, unneeded features, and lengthy contract negotiations with clients ahead of time.

### Autonomous teams

All of our teams are able to produce and release working software by themselves. They are self-organizing and take responsibility for developing and releasing different aspects of our software. Teams are able to design, implement and release changes to software products without the need of hand-offs, approvals, or dependencies on another team. 

Every organization is founded on the fact that its employees do more than their assigned tasks. A body as complex as an organization cannot be planned into every minute detail. Autonomy of work, autonomy of communication is mandatory. If people are micro-managed or forced into overbearing bureaucratic processes our organization's deliveries comes to a halt.

### Continuous improvement

We never reach peak performance. Organizations, technology, and the market change over time, so should our software processes. We are not done by implementing software collaboration once and patting ourselves on the back, but continuously analyze and improve our ways of doing things.

We encourage our teams and individuals to continuously improve our processes and practices. We instill a blameless culture of continual experimentation where failure is considered part of learning and innovation.

## Sociotechnical interdependence

If we automate bad practices, we increase the quantity of bad practices, not the quality. Conversely, implementing agile project management without the necessary technical processes leads to confusion, frustration, and eventual lingering resentment.

The social and the technical are two interdependent parts of the same system. Technology and automation can pave the way to make it easy to do the right thing.
