# Blameless culture

When humans are blamed and punished for errors, we nourish a self-centered community that opposes transparent communication, leading to covering up mistakes and pushing them down the line. When discovered in time, these mistakes are costly to fix.

Instead, we treat human error as a symptom of the system and ask ourselves how we got here in the first place and how we can avoid it in the future. When we tackle issues cooperatively, we reframe them as learning opportunities.

If coworkers feel free to share their mistakes, it leads to increased transparency and trust within the team. At a minimum, it will instruct coworkers on how to avoid costly errors without having to directly experience them. When we offer a safe environment to fail fast and fail often, we grow the accumulative body of knowledge within an organization.

## Building a culture

A culture does not define what we do; what we do defines our culture. We cannot change people's behavior by changing their minds; we change their minds by changing people's behavior. Hence, a culture is the result of the sociotechnical changes we apply within our organization.

The processes and strategies in this book will support our organization to embrace a blameless culture. However, we should actively measure and encourage our progress internally if we want to succeed in establishing a competitive organization.
