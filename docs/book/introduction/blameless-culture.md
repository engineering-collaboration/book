# Blameless culture

When humans are blamed and punished for errors we nourish a self-centered community that opposes transparent communication, which leads to covering up mistakes and pushing them down the line. When discovered in time, these mistakes are costly to fix.

Instead we treat human error as a symptom of the system. How did we get here in the first place and how can we avoid it in the future? When we tackle issues cooperatively, we reframe them as learning opportunities.

When coworkers feel free to share their mistakes, it leads to increased transparency and trust within the team. As a minimum it will instruct coworkers in how to avoid a costly errors without having to directly experience it. When we offer a safe environment to fail fast and fail often, we grow the accumulative body of knowledge within an organization. 

## Building a culture

A culture does not define what we do, what we do defines our culture. We cannot change peoples behavior by changing their minds, we change their minds by changing peoples behavior. Hence, a culture is the result of the sociotechnical changes we apply within our organization. 

The processes and strategies in this book will support our organization to embrace a blameless culture. However, we should actively measure and encourage our progress internally if we want to succeed in establishing a competitive organization.
