# Introduction

Successful software companies adapt to rapid technological, economic, and political changes to viably compete in any market. This fact introduces the paradox of providing a stable and low-latency experience while continuously responding to user feedback and regulatory compliance.

Within *OpenCollaboration*, we discuss intramural strategies that have proven useful for a broad spectrum of organizations. This brief literary excursion provides the foundation for building an autonomous, flexible, and collaborative environment at the core of our company.

## Structure

*OpenCollaboration* is structured into three sections, addressing engineering processes at different levels of our organization.

- [*The Anatomy of a Software Company*](../anatomy-of-a-software-company/README.md) covers organic cross-team collaboration while limiting noise. We discuss established strategies for nurturing a growth mindset to sustainably increase the complexity of our product and expand the number of teams within our organization. The topics discussed in this section address problems encountered by technology officers and software architects.
- [*The Anatomy of Managing a Team*](../anatomy-of-managing-a-team/README.md) frames supporting principles for supporting individual contributors and promoting a productive team. We cover the merits of leading by influence and the necessities of leading by authority. This section discusses the professional challenges of technical and team leads.
- [*The Anatomy of a Code Change*](../anatomy-of-a-code-change/) analyzes good practices for the day-to-day work of engineers to achieve software products with high adaptability and stability. This section presents workflows and automation concepts to increase the frequency of our software deliveries. These solutions are the foundation of sustainable growth and are applied by engineers across all levels.

The order of the book's sections has caused us much deliberation. The current structure follows a reciprocal typical career progression of an engineer, which seems counterintuitive from careers point of view. It also indirectly communicates a top-down approach to problem solving. We have found bottom-up to be more immediately effective.

Ultimately the order stands for 2 reasons. It provides a gradual view into increasing details. From a broad company wide strategy to lines of code, communicating the ultimate value of every contribution, market competitiveness (instead of shiny coding practices). Secondly, organizational change realistically can only happen with the backing of leadership. Certain sociotechnical dependencies become more visible when digesting the entire book.

## What this Book is NOT

### This is not an Engineering Book

A couple of decades ago, the core business of an organization was run through sales, marketing, and HR departments. IT was considered a necessary cost factor that was at best overlooked, at worst the first target of budget cuts. Today, the situation appears to be reversed.

This book covers a lot of ground, and not all of it is confined within an engineering frustum. When reading this book, we consider how the practices described within can be used in tandem with departments outside of engineering. We might improve the efficiency of our communication channels within our iteration process.

This book does not include source code, does not advocate for any particular tech stack, and does not assume the use of any tool or platform (~*~ *The Anatomy of a Code Change* requires experience with version control).

### This is not a Step-by-Step Guide

At best, this book may be used as a reference or as a starting point for evolving our organization. We do not try to change an entire organization overnight.

The goal of our organization is to solve the problems of our customers. We avoid blankly copying processes of successful companies, as we might not necessarily understand why those processes are successful within that company.

That being said, we found the concepts written in this book to be helpful for a broad spectrum of software companies and are pretty confident that readers will accumulate some benefit.

### This is not a Bible

We avoid the term "best practices" in this book. "Best" is subject to industries, personalities, geographic location, diversity of staff, size of organization, and numerous other factors; using the superlative is pure hubris. The strategies in this book are shared without righteous zeal.

The concepts discussed in this book should be applied by implementing small changes for a limited number of teams. We reduce the cost and risk of verifying the positive effect we intend to implement in our organization by testing the changes within an isolated team.

Lastly, while we do our best to keep the language as inclusive as possible, there is a non-zero chance that certain words or phrases will not be received in the way they were meant to be. Language is difficult. The written word is difficult. Please read this book with the positive intent that it was penned in.

## Current Progress

We are hard at work on *The Anatomy of a Code Change* and are releasing new chapters periodically. A breakdown of our progress with a detailed list of chapters is available on the individual section pages.
