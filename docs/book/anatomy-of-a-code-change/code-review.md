# Code review

pre-merge review vs post-merge

sync vs async

do not explain decisions in code review, fix code to be explanatory

code reviews are not a platform for discussing implementation strategies

Request reviews by certain personell or personell groups. These reviews are essential for consistent high quality code integrations and horizontal distribution of knowledge. There are various strategies on who to request reviews from depending on team size and the nature of our changes.

It typically makes sense to involve people across two ends of a spectrum, e.g. one senior person and one junior person can share different insights during the review. Having people across departments review our code improves cross department collaboration and spreads the knowledge horizontally.

Should it appear that a major burden of the code reviews are done by a limited amount of number, consider implementing processes or tools that spreads review requests evenly across team members.

linters, style checkers, and code analyzers to catch simple mistakes before manual review. use available tools, such as suggestions, AI

Establish clear guidelines and expectations for the code review process. This includes defining the scope, the goals, and the timeline of the code review. Transplarently communicate both what to do and what not to do.

Feedback should be constructive and aimed at improving the code, not criticizing the person who wrote it. positive intent by the receiving party

Provide Specific Feedback: suggest alternatives if necessary.

Collaborate and Discuss: Code reviews should be a collaborative process, with both the reviewer and the developer working together to improve the code. encourage discussion and open communication to ensure that everyone is on the same page. learn from previous reviews and use this knowledge to improve the code review process. This includes identifying common mistakes and establishing good practices for code development.

If someone does well at something and the praise they recieve is "Good hob, you're so smart", the emphasis on smartness pushes them toward a fixed mindset. If, on the other hand, someone is given the praise "Good job, you worked hard on that", they will associate the their successes with the effort they put in.

It's one thing to assume good intentions, but can we go further? What good intentions can I identify with that this person holds? What might their positive motivations be?
