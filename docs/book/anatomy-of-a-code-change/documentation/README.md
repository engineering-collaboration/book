Everybodies favourite topic. Documentation is the one topic 99% of the industry agree that it is insufficiently done and 98% agree that writing additional documentation is a hassle they cannot be arsed to do. Throughout our industry we consensually lament the lack of documentation across the board.

docs as code

vale.sh

These are the phrases everybody was taught while learning programming.

"I don't even know what I did 6 months ago."

So if this is taught as a basis of software engineering, why is this still a problem?
The problem is that while being taught software engineering, it is an inherently isolated task. You wrote the code, you submitted the code, and the code is reviewed without you present. Besides "cheating" and sharing code assignments in University there is no code collaboration. This means every graduate can invert a binary tree and tell you the Big O performance of dictionaries, but no graduate has experience writing documentation.

Teaching documentation is the responsibility of engineering companies.

- Explicitly plan documentation tickets
- Make documentation part of the review process
- Make it worthwhile and findable... it's a waste of time if nobody reads it
- Automate as much as possible
- Know your audience
