# Who's gonna read it?

While putting words to document consider how these words will eventually be received.

- Culture (language, level of sophistication, humor)
- Discipline (terms)
- What are they trying to achieve?

The absolute first priority when writing documentation has to be findability. The most informative testament of engineering brilliance written in beautiful prose with well thought out examples shares its value with a napkin on my desk if its just as difficult to find.

## Documentation for Product

For some to me inexplicable reason PM's love Confluence. Offer alternatives and accept your PM's final word. Then make machines do the writing. As with any code I am a big fan of embeding your documentation into a git repository and track the changes that way.

Keep in mind this is documentation that YOU as the engineer want to share with the PM. It is not your job. Typically these are things regarding research of existing technology, reports on prototypes, decision making processes on the final product implementation.

This is the stuff you reference when a couple months down the line a product owner changes their mind.

## Documentation for Engineering

"I am not too interested in the internals, I just want to spin it up and try it out."

If over the last month five people asked you

"Where do I find the implementation of that particular behaviour?"

you might consider adding a FAQ to the docs.

Documentation of processes.

## Documentation for Clients

Intuitive guide for pain points.
