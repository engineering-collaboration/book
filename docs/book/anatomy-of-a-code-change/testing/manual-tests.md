# Manual tests

The feasibility of automated tests has its limits. Human usability aspects are best evaluated with human judgement.

## Product

Explorative manual testing appraises the quality of output and interoperability our software generates and its significance and validity to the given context. Interdisciplinary product decisions regarding usability and user experience require vision, creativity, and domain experience.

We can automate supporting processes for manual testing, e.g. we can statically analyse if every image on a webpage has an alt text, but it becomes unpractical to analyse if the alt text correctly describes the image. The same with design systems. We can statically verify our system is Do the loaded fonts correlate with the design system. Are buttons loaded with correct colors and hover animations? Enforcing an established design system is 

Aestethic improvements, user experience, transparency, clicks to purchase.
Is behaviour learned from other sources applicable to this product?
Is behaviour within this prouct consistent?

## Security

During security tests and penetration tests allies uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in our system before malicious entities take advantage of them. Domain experts stress the boundaries in systems, trying to effectively break our software. Broken states in our systems lead to flaws in our product, e.g. multiple shipments of a single order.

## Executing manual tests

Strategies in user experience and accessability steadily move from manual testing to automated testing. As security testing shifted left more and more our terms evolved, DevOps is referred to DevSecOps.
Move Manual testing to automated testing

Security Engineers and QA Engineers work closely with product owners, feature engineers, site reliability engineers, and the user base to evolve feature life-cycles and testing strategies.
