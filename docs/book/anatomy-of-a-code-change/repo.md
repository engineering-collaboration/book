# Repo

## Monorepo

## Multiple repos

## The basics of a repository

Regardless of your repository design strategy, your typical repository should cover 

- Code
- Versioning
- Wiki and Docs
- Codeowners
- Communication and support channels
- Artifacts


## Standardize onboarding

Certain domains have established good practices when it comes to Documentation.

Instead of standardizing documentation practices and platforms we instead standardize a README which provides directions and locations of where to find the desired information.



Ensure consistent tooling throughout teams (at a minimum) and schemas throughout organizations.

- Versioning
- Wiki and Docs
- Codeowners
- Communication and support channels
- Artifacts
