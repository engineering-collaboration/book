# Artifact management

Building a release produces a cornucopia of artifacts for various distributions, all of which related to each other and are administered together. Depending on our product single release may build:

- An executable binary
- A static or dynamic library
- A container image
- Resource definitions for IaC
- Static Documentation
- Interactive Documentation
- Test doubles for medium and large scale tests
- Licenses, signings, certifications

The above list showcases interdependency between artifacts of a release. The artifacts reference hard versions of each other and are useless if not found or drift. Our storage reference hard versions of the release artifacts and are available separately. Documentation of a specific version is available.

## Dependency Management

Besides self-dependent artifacts, our build relies on vertical or down-stream dependencies. Dependency management is complex and a problem not solved to date.

Dependency management has become somewhat of a complex computational conundrum. Increasing intricacy of software products and platforms

## Semantic Versioning

!!! quote "[semver.org](https://semver.org/)"
    *In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called “dependency hell.” The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.*

To move the burden of identifying version dependencies from technological tools to sociocultural supervision, we tag our releases following a pattern standardized as semantic versioning. With the titular practice we infer the impact of changes from the structure of the release version `major.minor.patch`, e.g. `v1.23.45`.

- We increment the `major` version, when we make incompatible API changes.
- We increment the `minor` version, when we add functionality in a backward compatible manner.
- We increment the `patch` version, when we make backward compatible bug fixes.

Semantic versioning is a best effort solution to dependency management. The practice includes flaws and we accompany version bumps of our upstream dependencies with testing and security introspections. Assuming that releases are labeled correctly in the first place, Hyrum's law states that every public-facing behavior of a implementation will be relied upon, including incidental actions. Patch releases to our dependencies may be not compatible with our current system, if they coincidentally modify non-deterministic data layouts or execution time.

Nevertheless, it's one of the better systems we currently have and we would be foolhardy not to follow it.

## Upstream Dependencies

It is neither achievable, advisable, nor affordable to build every facet of our software internally. We solve problems relating to our business cases. We avoid reinventing the wheel, working on problems with publicly available solutions, avoid the Not Invented Here Syndrome is a decision-making error where we tend to value our own ideas above those conceived by people outside of our group.

We routinely include packages of third-party providers, open-source solutions, or licensed software. Licensing, security, avaiablity.

On top of manual due diligence, we employ technology and automation to verify the security and authorized usage of our dependencies. Vulnerabilities originating from third party modules due to human error, heterogeneous systems, or malicious intentions. Unpinned dependencies or outsourced dependencies provide attack vectors for supply chain attacks.

Relying on the internet for our dependencies means that somebody else owns the availability and consistency of our builds.

## Build and Test dependencies

Hermetic environments. Caching. Pinned versions of build software.

The same for the environment of our build machines, if our hermetic environment runs install scripts and `apt-get` is down, we will not be able to build and release.
