# Tags

The most common way to mark and trigger releases is to tag a commit on the `trunk` branch with a certain format. Typically this is `v0.0.0` or `r0.0.0` and `rc0.0.0` for release candidates. Naturally, the format can be whatever makes most sense for our product or department.

This is the most straight forward way to implement a release workflow and all major VCS platforms come equipped with the tooling to listen to tags on certain branches.
