# Live at `HEAD`

Live at head is the holy grail of TBD and CI/CD. The closer we can get to this, the more flexible and agile our entire company is.

This is difficult. Our testing and deployment strategies have to be solid. Even if Live-at-head is done manually with release tags, this is what we are aiming for when implementing TBD and CI/CD.
