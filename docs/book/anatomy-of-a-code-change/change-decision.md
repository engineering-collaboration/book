Make a decision and document it. Easier for people to accept a conscious decision if the decision making process is available.
Document the outcome of a decision, to track successful and unsuccessful patterns.

Document, review, and iterate to ensure every participant understands the same thing. Take notes during meetings and share them with everybody to avoid misunderstandings.

Keep all of the above decisions and progress visible and public to all stakeholders. Update continously. Maybe tooling that accumulates PR, issue comments, documentation, kanban boards, design docs etc.
