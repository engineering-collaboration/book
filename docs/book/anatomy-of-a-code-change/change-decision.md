# Game plan

## Documenting decisions

Decision making is always speculative. Even with lots of data to rely on, we are predicting the future.

Make a decision and document it. Easier for people to accept a conscious decision if the decision making process is available.
Document the outcome of a decision, to track successful and unsuccessful patterns.

Document, review, and iterate to ensure every participant understands the same thing. Take notes during meetings and share them with everybody to avoid misunderstandings.

Keep all of the above decisions and progress visible and public to all stakeholders. Update continously. Maybe tooling that accumulates PR, issue comments, documentation, kanban boards, design docs etc.

The more context we are able to give, the more transparent our decision is communicated. When evaluating the use of different libraries add the name and version of the libraries, benchmark numbers, ease of implementation, licensing, projected maintenance work etc.

We clearly define the evaluation process that led to our final decision with all aspects. Every decision has advantages and drawbacks which need to be documented and unambiguously weighed against each other.

Parameters change over time and decisions will be reevaluated.


## Process within a code change

product roadmap
design docs
PR reference

After product features have been milled into sprint tasks and the tasks assigned to respective teams and engineers we start planning our implementation. For larger scoped changes or inter team changes we advise writing a design document with behavior expectations. These documents are short references to avoid misunderstandings between all stakeholders in the implementation process and typically contain expected input and output parameters, REST, GRPC or GraphQL schemas or domain specific agreements such as storage decisions based on data access frequency.

We avoid turning this process into unnecessary red tape by only involving the minimum amount of people and discussing the minimum of shared requirements, typically the engineer implementing the task, an engineer from the customer team, and optionally a tech lead. These conversations happen organically verbally or in team chats. We make it a habit of copying the information to a publicly available platform.

### Implementation strategies

Opensource
Innersource
Build it

Ask innersource channel, stackoverflow, team, tech leads, tech community. Always prefere existing solutions. Problems are always more difficult than initially assumed.

The implementing engineer utlimately pulls the trigger on the decision and is trusted to ultimately make the decision.

Document the decision on whatever platform, or PR, reference the design doc.


The implementing engineer has full trust on implementation decisions as long as the output matches the agreed upon design doc. Should implementation decisions turn out to be costly the design doc may be revisited with the stakeholders.
