# Merging

Depending on the discipline, concept of repository streams, and branch isolation, merging changes differs between version control solutions. Universally, we discuss the idea of re-integrating changes to our main software product, or uniting changes of differing origins.

!!! note
    Since merging varies between tooling, we focus on the practices within Git. This chapter is one of the rare exceptions that includes technical commands and ties to a specific platform.

*Git* includes various strategies on converging changes to a single destination branch. Ungoverned, our project might grow in unnecessary complexity, include opaque processes, or lose information relevant for future fixes. This chapter details merging policies for successful lon-term integrations in trunk-based development.

## Linear history

Regardless or our approach, when merging changes into software, we ensure a linear history of our project. The parent commit of our development branch is the latest commit on main. A linear history sequentially chronicles the evolution of our software and streamlines future reactionary development.

Sometimes we introduce unexpected breaking changes. A non-linear history complicates identifying and reverting a offending commit. If left unattended, a non-linear history breaches the point of illegibility and emerges as being utterly useless. Future bug fixes and tracking changes over a period time devolve into frustratingly hair-pulling endeavors.

## Rebase

We sprouted our development branch off of the latest commit of main when sowing the seeds our work. Chances are, while developing our feature, our colleagues integrated their tasks into the main branch, thus putting us in the position of cultivating a non-linear history should we merge our botanical offshoot into the trunk unchanged.

In order to rectify our entanglement, we rebase our work on the latest commit on main, fix occurring conflicts, and integrate our changes after passing our automated test suite. A rebase precedes any merge into our main branch.

!!! note
    When rebasing a branch we create new commits on our local machine that do no longer mirror the state of our remote repository. We either force push (with-lease) our changes, overriding the state of the remote repository or create a new branch from the head of our development branch and rebase and push that one; abandoning our development branch.

## Squash and merge

Squashing an arbitrary amount of consecutive commits combines and replaces those changes into a single commit. By consolidating work-in-progress commits or bilaterally annulling commits we reduce noise in our project history.

Most source control platforms offer the option of a server side *Squash and Merge* approach when integrating changes of a completed pull request (PR). The procedure squashes all commits of our development branch and appends our changes to the main branch as a single commit.

For short-lived development branches focusing on fixing or adding a single responsibility, the development steps are less important than the changes themselves and the commits may be squashed and merged. Complex issues are documented as inline comments or within the PR description.

With an hypothetical average of ten commits per development branch; by squashing, we reduce the growth of commits over time from 10,000 commits to 1,000 commits.

## Merge commit

On occasion, the complexity of achieving a tasks or the volume of changes across multiple files requires chronological cataloging for transparency. Merge commits allow us to preserve the development commits we created within the repository without clobbering the main branch.

The particular branching view of a merge commit allows us to either ignore the development commits when analyzing the main branch via `git log` or `git bisect`, or step into them if we are interested in the history of the changes.

[This *GitHub* blog article](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) details practices for advanced users of *Git* about structuring a story of our commits when merging our work via a merge commit. The well-written paper outlines how thematically organized commits increase the readability of changes by spanning the dramatic arc of our development process; from partial implementations, to tests, refactors, polish, and documentation.

## Cherry picking

The act of cherry picking commits cannot in good conscience be described as a merge. It is however, an additional way of transferring select commits between branches. The command `git cherry-pick` allows us to append an existing commit to our current `HEAD`.

Optionally, cherry picking applies the contents of a commit to our current workspace, rather than appending a commit itself. This permits us to edit the content or revert unwanted modifications bundled within the cherry-picked change before creating a new commit in our development branch.

## Resolving conflicts

*Git* merges compatible changes automatically. Resolving conflicts, however, requires manual intervention. We compare the clashing lines of changes and rectify the discord by editing the changes to accept a change from either source or manually edit a functioning resolution containing workings of both origins.

When rebasing changes we find ourselves recurrently resolving the same lines across commits; such is the nature of this process. We minimize our rebasing effort by integrating changes frequently into main, rebasing our development branch frequently, squashing development commits of our development branch.
