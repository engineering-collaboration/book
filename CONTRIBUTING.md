## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). If we have never contributed before, [the first timer's guide on the *auth0* blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) showcases tips on how to get started. A few general guidelines:

- We create Issues for chapter drafts, major edits, and distribution changes before starting any work.
- No Issues are needed for proofreading tasks and minor edits. Feedback is handled in PRs.
- We search for existing Issues and PRs before creating our own.

We work hard to ensure issues are handled in a timely manner, but a friendly ping in the comment thread as a reminder is welcome.

## Prose

The contents of this book follow four basic editorial rules for prose which are enforced with our linting tools.

- The book addresses readers exclusively in the plural first-person form, *we*. We do not use *I* or *you*.
- We write with certainty. *Trunk based development can support CI/CD* becomes *Trunk based development supports CI/CD*.
- We avoid weasel words and unnecessary filler words.
- When feasible, we prefer English Prime. We avoid all forms of the verb *to be*.

## Linting

We verify our prose using [vale.sh](), an open-source, command-line tool for editorial style guides. Download and install the tool via [the installation instructions](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/).

This repository contains two MkDocs configurations. `mkdocs.yaml` for local development and `mkdocs-dist.yaml` for building and distributing the published site. The configurations differ mainly in the navigation section.

The bash script located at `ci/vale.bash` parses `mkdocs-dist.yaml` and analysis only the chapters to be published. This eliminates noise for work in progress notes when linting our prose using the following command.

```sh
bash ci/vale.bash
```

PRs will only be integrated with zero errors, warnings, or suggestions.

> When polishing our chapter we comment the line `write-good.E-Prime = NO` in `.vale.ini`. While english prime is too confining of a requirement for integration testing, it does highlight potential writing improvements.

## Pull Request

To successfully integrate our changes into the main branch, we follow some basic rules.

- For major edits, drafts, and meta changes we open an Issue to discuss our proposal first.
- We limit the changes to the topic in question.
- We label our PR accordingly
- We retain a linear commit history. We rebase locally on latest main and force push our development branch, then merge using the *Squash and merge* option.

Non-maintainers follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr).

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
